# DownWork Android — handoff: what only the founder can plug in

Everything below is a placeholder today. The app builds, runs and demos without any of it: with no
backend URL it uses the in-app demo backend, and the debug build already points at the backend's dev
stage. Each item says where the value goes. Backend and iOS keep their own lists; items marked (shared)
are the same credential used by more than one repo.

## Accounts and keys

| # | Item | Where it goes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Play Console app** for `com.raviga.downwork` (Raviga Apps Private Limited), name "DownWork" | Play Console → Create app | not created |
| 2 | **Four consumable in-app products**: `credits_10`, `credits_25`, `credits_50`, `credits_100` with INR prices (₹9,999 / ₹24,999 / ₹49,999 / ₹99,999 proposed; the backend's `/config` carries the credit amounts) (shared with the App Store) | Play Console → Monetise → In-app products | not created |
| 3 | **RevenueCat** project with the Android app, the Google public SDK key `goog_…`, Play service-account credentials, and the webhook URL + shared secret from the backend (shared) | `secrets.properties` → `REVENUECAT_API_KEY`; backend SSM | missing |
| 4 | **Firebase project** with the Android app `com.raviga.downwork` (and `com.raviga.downwork.debug` for debug builds) added; download `google-services.json`; give the backend the service-account JSON for FCM (shared) | `app/google-services.json` (gitignored) | missing |
| 5 | **Upload key** for Play App Signing: a keystore plus `keystore.properties` with `storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword` | `keystore.properties` (gitignored) | missing; release builds are unsigned until then |
| 6 | **Production API URL** once the backend deploys prod | `secrets.properties` → `API_BASE_URL` | placeholder |
| 7 | **Legal pages**: the backend now serves Terms and Privacy itself (`/v1/legal/terms`, `/v1/legal/privacy`) and `/config` points at them; the app opens whatever `/config` says. Read them once before launch | backend | served; needs your read-through |
| 8 | **Grievance officer** (you, membersupport@miraquill.com, 15-day response) and support email are live in `/config`. The registered company address is still a stand-in ("Raviga Apps Private Limited, India") | backend `/config` → `legal.companyAddress`, `legal.grievance.address` | address to confirm |
| 9 | **Play Data safety form** and the microphone / notifications declarations; the app collects voice (processed by OpenAI), project text, device identifier, purchase history | Play Console → App content | to fill |
| 10 | **AWS role policy** for `DownWorkDeployRole` (currently AdministratorAccess per the backend contract); the Connect AWS screen describes the role in plain words | backend CloudFormation template | to decide |

## Verified against the backend dev stage (2026-10-09)

The whole lifecycle ran from the Android app on an emulator against the real dev API: register →
terms → typed description → AI consent → generate (real OpenAI draft, job polling) → the rendered brief →
quote (93 credits, Standard) → submit (document locked, team emailed) → team comment → edit Summary (version 2)
→ re-quote (95) → resubmit (2-credit difference charged) → approved → team comment → delivered → revision
requested → delivered again → AWS done → accepted. Also: versions list and preview, credits ledger, delivery
targets, AWS connect (external ID issued), settings, privacy screen. All 31 of the iOS session's captured dev
responses decode with the Android models (`app/src/test/resources/fixtures`).

Contract v0.5 (document upload, screening, retention) was then run on dev the same way: re-consent
to the 2026-10-09 terms → upload a PDF → "Here's what we read" → file input → generated brief, and a
policy refusal shown with the appeal line. The on-device check for keys, cards, Aadhaar and PAN, the
refused-project block and the demo backend's equivalents were exercised in demo mode.

Contract v0.6 (local-first) was run on dev too: re-consent to the 2026-10-10 terms → typed notes with an
AWS key kept on purpose → `/ai/draft` (server removed it, notice shown, local note redacted) → `/quotes` (104)
→ `POST /projects` (DW-DWPJBD, the first time the brief reached the server) → team requested changes → edited
on the phone → re-quoted (95) → resubmitted (9 credits back) → approved → delivered → accepted → the server
deleted the brief and title, and the phone's copy is still readable. Drafts on disk were checked to be
ciphertext. A PDF and a Word file were read on the phone, in debug and in the R8 release build.

The minified release build (R8, signed with a local debug key) was also installed and run against dev:
register → terms → typed description → AI consent → generated brief → quote, all decoding correctly.
`./gradlew bundleRelease` refuses to build until items 3 to 6 are in place (`checkReleaseReadiness`), so
a Play upload cannot ship the demo backend by accident; `assembleRelease` stays open for local checks.

Not exercised end to end: voice capture (the emulator has no on-device speech recogniser; on a real phone
running Android 12+ the on-device `SpeechRecognizer` drives live dictation and the ink line), OCR of a scanned
PDF (ML Kit's model comes from Play services on first use), store purchases (no RevenueCat key), and push
(no `google-services.json`). The code paths exist and compile; they need the items above.

## Decisions I made that you may want to change

- Local-first, per your request: drafts are sealed on the phone (AES-256-GCM, Keystore key, no backup), so
  a draft cannot be recovered on another phone or after a reinstall; only submitted projects move with the
  recovery key. Voice needs Android 12+ with an offline speech model (most phones sold in India since 2022);
  older phones type or upload instead, because the only alternative would send audio to Google's cloud.
- Reading PDFs on the phone adds about 6.5 MB to the app (PDFBox); scans use ML Kit through Play services.
- 1 credit = ₹1,000; brackets micro/starter/standard/pro/enterprise; two included revision rounds; quotes
  valid 14 days; auto-accept 14 days after delivery; the server deletes a brief when its project closes. All of these live in the backend
  `/config`; the app renders whatever it is sent.
- Notifications permission is asked once on the home screen (Android 13+). Change in `HomeScreen.kt`.
- Light appearance only (white background per your brief). Instrument Serif (open licence) for the
  document voice, Roboto for everything else.
- `minSdk 26` (Android 8.0, covers ~97% of Indian Android devices); `targetSdk 36` as Play requires.

## Risks to know before store review

- **Google Play's payments policy** (like App Store guideline 3.1.3(e)): in-app billing is meant for digital
  content used inside the app. DownWork sells a real-world service delivered outside the app. Review may
  push back. Options: position credits as a prepaid digital balance consumed in-app for AI drafting and
  quoting (true today), or move project payment to an external invoice. Decide before submission; no code
  depends on it beyond the Credits screen copy.
- The microphone is only used while the Capture screen is listening, and speech is recognised on the phone.
  The Data safety form can say no audio or files are collected; the text of notes and briefs is sent to
  OpenAI to write and price briefs (kept up to 30 days for abuse checks, per the backend's provider line),
  and submitted briefs are stored until the project closes.

## How to run it tomorrow

1. Open the folder in Android Studio, or from a terminal: `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
2. Plug in the OnePlus (or start the `DownWork_API34` emulator; the `Pixel_6_API_34` one has a pattern
   lock) and press Run, or `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
3. The debug build talks to the backend's dev stage (`secrets.properties`, already on this Mac). Drafting
   uses OpenAI; credits on dev need the backend's admin flow until RevenueCat is connected.
4. For a self-contained demo with no network: Settings → "Demo backend (debug)" on, restart the app. Then
   Describe a project → "Use a sample description" (or speak) → the brief writes itself → Get a quote → Buy
   credits (instant) → Submit → Settings → Demo controls → "Advance the latest project" to play the team's
   moves (comment, approve, deliver) → Accept.
