# DownWork Android — design notes

The design system is owned by iOS: `DownWork iOS/docs/DESIGN.md` ("Workshop", direction A, approved by the
founder on 2026-10-09; it replaced "Wet ink, dry ink"). This file records only how Android mirrors it and
where the platform differs. The fonts and pictures are the same files iOS ships.

## Tokens → code

| Design | Android |
|---|---|
| colours (paper `#FBFAF7`, surface, ink, graphite, ash, rule, ruleStrong, wash, teal, tealWash/tealInk, marigold, marigoldWash/marigoldInk, moss, amber, brick) | `ui/theme/Color.kt` (`Ink` object); also mapped onto the Material 3 scheme in `Theme.kt`. `res/values/colors.xml` carries paper, ink and teal for the splash and launcher |
| type scale (hero 38, display 48, title 32, heading 21, dictation 26, body 17/25, bodyMedium 17 semibold, secondary 15/21, button 17 semibold, caption 13/18, chip 13 bold) with the doc's tracking | `ui/theme/Type.kt` (`DwType`), all in sp so font scaling works; `includeFontPadding = false` |
| Bricolage Grotesque (Bold opsz 48, SemiBold opsz 24, Medium opsz 32) and Figtree (400/500/600/700, Italic 400) | `res/font/bricolage_*.ttf`, `res/font/figtree_*.ttf`: the static instances iOS made, OFL; licence in `assets/licenses/OFL.txt`, shown under Settings > Fonts |
| 8pt grid, 20pt gutter (24 on Welcome), 12pt between tiles | `ui/theme/Dimens.kt` (`Dw`), in dp |
| buttons 56 tall radius 18; fields surface radius 16 with a rule border (teal 1.5 when focused); tiles radius 24; pictures radius 20 (24 for headers, 18 for thumbnails, 32 bottom corners on Welcome); mic 72; status mark 8 | `Dw.*`; `PrimaryButton`/`SecondaryButton`/`TertiaryButton`, `DwTextField`, `BoxedEditor`, `Modifier.tile()` |
| chips (plain / teal / marigold, dot or icon) | `Chip`, `ChipRow` (FlowRow) in `ui/components/Workshop.kt` |
| pictures | `res/drawable-nodpi/illo_*.webp` (the iOS `Illo*.imageset` files through `cwebp -q 88 -alpha_q 100 -m 6`, about 0.8 MB for all eleven); `Picture` enum, `Illustration` (cropped around a focus point), `HeroIllustration` (full bleed, Welcome), `SpotIllustration` (the transparent ones) |
| hairline 1px | `Dw.hairline = 1.dp` |

Light appearance only: no `values-night`, `enableEdgeToEdge` with light system bars, no dynamic colour.
Sheets and dialogs sit on `surface`; the describe chooser sheet stays on `paper` so its white tiles read.

## Pictures → screens

| Picture | Where |
|---|---|
| Welcome | `WelcomeScreen` page 1, full bleed under the status bar, 46% of the screen (240 to 440 dp) so the four promises fit above the button |
| Describe, Quote, AIBuild, Delivered | Welcome pages 2 to 5 ("Step N of 4"), 34% of the screen (200 to 320 dp), one scene per step. Describe (one person speaking, typing and uploading) is used only there. AIBuild (clay robots building the app, an engineer approving) is used only there; Building is on the status screen only |
| HomeEmpty | empty `HomeScreen`, 220 dp |
| Speak / Type / Upload | chooser tiles (`DescribeChoices`), 84 dp thumbnails |
| Writing | reading a document, writing the brief (Capture and Document), pricing (Quote): 180 to 220 dp spot |
| Quote | `QuoteScreen` header, 190 dp |
| Building | `StatusScreen` header while submitted, changes requested, approved or in revision |
| Delivered | `StatusScreen` header once delivered or accepted, `DeliveryScreen`, `GoLiveScreen` |
| Credits | beside the balance on `CreditsScreen`, 124 dp |
| Privacy | Terms ("Before you start" only), Privacy and data, the Quote's privacy promise (72 dp) |

## Screens → routes

| Design screen | Route (`ui/nav/Routes.kt`) | Composable |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome | `welcome` | `WelcomeScreen` |
| Terms | `terms` | `TermsScreen` |
| Home | `home` | `HomeScreen` (project tiles, credits pill with a marigold dot) |
| Describe chooser (Speak / Type / Upload a document) | bottom sheet on Home and Document | `DescribeChooserSheet` / `DescribeChoices` |
| Capture, Transcript / "Here's what we read", Choices, Drafting | `capture/{projectId}?mode=&tab=` | `CaptureScreen` (phases in one screen so the dictation state survives the transition; text tabs Speak, Type, Upload; accent picker on Speak) |
| Sensitive-data check | bottom sheet on the review step | `SensitiveSheet` in `CaptureScreen`, patterns in `data/screening/SensitiveScan.kt` (the server's L1 list: `DownWork Backend/src/downwork/screening/secrets.py`) |
| AIConsent | `ai_consent` | `AiConsentScreen` (returns `ai_consent_granted` through the back stack entry) |
| Document | `document/{projectId}?reveal=` | `DocumentScreen` (square plus beside "Get a quote" for Add more) |
| SectionEditor, Regenerate | `section/{projectId}/{sectionId}` + bottom sheet | `SectionEditorScreen`, `RegenerateSheet` |
| Versions | `versions/{projectId}`, `version/{projectId}/{v}` | `VersionsScreen`, `VersionPreviewScreen` |
| Quote + DeliveryTargets inline | `quote/{projectId}` | `QuoteScreen` (breakdown tile, marigold bracket chip) |
| ConnectAWS | `connect_aws` | `ConnectAwsScreen` |
| ProjectStatus | `status/{projectId}` | `StatusScreen` |
| Delivery, RevisionRequest | `delivery/{projectId}` + bottom sheet | `DeliveryScreen` (repository, handover guide and Make it live tiles) |
| GoLive ("Make it live", 14b) | `golive/{projectId}` | `GoLiveScreen`, logic in `ui/status/GoLiveLogic.kt` (a port of iOS `GoLiveLogic`, same tests) |
| Credits | `credits` | `CreditsScreen` |
| Settings and children | `settings`, `settings/targets`, `settings/privacy`, `settings/recovery`, `settings/notifications`, `settings/fonts` | `SettingsScreen`, `SubScreens.kt` |

Status vocabulary (mark colours, row lines, detail titles, push lines) is in `ui/status/StatusCopy.kt`.

## Platform differences

- **Top bars.** iOS shows floating round buttons over the content (its navigation bar); Android keeps
  a plain 56 dp bar with a back arrow and teal text actions. Screen titles sit in the content in
  Bricolage, as on iOS.
- **Dictation.** Android has no in-process equivalent of `SFSpeechRecognizer` that can run
  alongside a recorder: the platform `SpeechRecognizer` lives in another process and takes the
  microphone. Capture uses only the on-device recogniser (`createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer`,
  Android 12+), restarted across pauses; on Android 13+ it checks the English model is installed
  and asks the phone to download it if not. Speech is English only (contract v0.7): the accent
  picker offers US, UK, India and Australia, defaulting from the phone's region as on iOS. It never
  falls back to cloud recognition and keeps no audio. Phones without it get "Type instead" /
  "Upload a document". The ink line follows the recognizer's RMS callback (about 10 Hz, interpolated).
- **Reduce motion.** Read from `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE == 0`: the ink line becomes a flat teal
  line that pulses opacity; the document reveal still runs but is a single fade per section.
- **Identity.** No Keychain: the token lives in EncryptedSharedPreferences and is excluded from
  backup, so "Move to another phone" (recovery key) matters more than on iOS. A 401 triggers a
  silent re-register with the same `installId`; if that returns a different client (this phone was
  revoked), the app starts over and Home offers the recovery key.
- **Uploads.** The system document picker (`OpenDocument`, filtered to `config.limits.acceptedFileTypes`
  plus `text/*`); the file is copied to cache, sized, typed by MIME or extension, read on the phone
  (PDFBox for text PDFs, ML Kit's on-device OCR for scans, parsers for Word/RTF/text/Markdown) and
  deleted. Nothing is uploaded. Choosing "Upload a document" in the chooser opens the picker
  straight away.
- **Links.** Privacy, terms, the repo, the handover guide and the CloudFormation quick-create URL open
  in a Chrome Custom Tab.
- **Prices.** In US dollars (contract v0.7): "about $X" is `quote.usd`, else credits x
  `config.credits.creditValueUsd`; pack tiles show Google Play's own price string, and
  `priceHintUsd` only until it loads. `util/Money.kt` formats them.
- **Notifications.** Asked once on Home (Android 13+). Push data with a `projectId` refreshes that
  project in the foreground; in the background FCM shows the notification and its tap carries
  `projectId` as an intent extra, which opens the project's own screen (brief, status or delivery).
- **Fonts and pictures** are bundled rather than fetched, so the first frame has the right face and
  picture with no Play Services dependency.

## Copy that lives in the app

- Welcome (five swipeable pages, `HorizontalPager`; page dots: current an 18x6 teal pill, others 6x6
  ruleStrong; "Get started" and "By <company>" pinned on every page): page 1 "Say what you want built." /
  "Describe it in your own words: say it, type it, or upload a document. We write the brief, quote it and
  build it." / chips, in the founder's order, "Working project delivered" (check), "Code handed to you" (teal
  dot), "You approve the quote" (marigold dot), "Super fast delivery" (bolt), two per row (no privacy chip:
  it's only true until submit). Pages
  2 to 5, "Step N of 4" in teal: "Describe it your way" / "Say it, type it, or upload a document you
  already have. We turn it into a clear brief you can edit."; "See the price first" / "You get a quote and
  a timeline before anything starts. Nothing is charged until you submit."; "Built by AI, checked by
  experts" / "AI builds your project at speed. Experts recommend the right tech stack, or use yours, and
  review the work before it reaches you."; "Ready before you know it" / "A working project, ready for your
  review, with the code, a handover guide and simple steps to make it live." (Steps 3 and 4 are the
  founder's exact words, iOS 489412c.)
- Founder rule: no other copy about who builds the project (team, AI, agents or robots) unless she approves it.
- Capture hint: "Tell us what it does, who it is for, and anything it must connect to. Ramble is fine."
- Empty home: "What should we build?" / "Describe what you want built: say it, type it, or upload a
  document you already have. We turn it into a brief you can edit, quote it, and build it."
- Chooser: "Describe your project" ("Whichever is easiest. You can mix them, and edit everything
  after.") / "Add to <title>" ("Add more detail, whichever way is easiest."); tiles Speak ("Talk it
  through. We write it up."), Type ("Write or paste a description."), Upload a document ("A
  PDF, Word or text file you already have."); teal note led by a bold "Your idea stays private", then
  "Your recordings and files never leave your phone. Drafts are kept only on this phone."
- Upload tab: "Upload a requirements document" / "A PDF, Word, RTF or text file up to 10 MB. We read
  the text, you check it, and the brief is written from it." / note "It's read on your phone. The file
  never leaves it, and only the text you check is kept, in your draft." / "Choose a file". Reading:
  "Reading <file>" / "Read on your phone. Long documents take a little longer."
- Review titles and hints: voice "Here's what we heard" / "Tap to fix anything that was misheard.";
  typed "Here's your description" / "Tap to edit before we write the brief."; upload "Here's what we
  read" / "From <file>, N pages" / the server's `notice` / "Tap to fix anything before we write the brief."
- One note per way of describing (as iOS, 0d5dabd). Review's second button: voice "Record more",
  typed "Edit what I typed" (both continue the same note in the same mode; the tabs give way to
  "Recording more" / "Adding more", and back returns to the review); document "Add more" (runs the
  sensitive-data check, saves the document as its own note, then shows the three choices with
  "Saved <file> to your draft." or "Saved N notes to your draft." and "Write the brief now").
  Back from a document review picks another file.
- Writing: "Writing your brief" with the job's step line in teal; pricing: "Pricing your brief".
- Sensitive data: "This looks like it includes <up to two kinds, then 'and other secrets'>." /
  "We never need passwords, keys or ID numbers to build your project, and it's safer not to share
  them." Buttons "Remove them", "Keep as is", "Edit".
- Quote: "<N> credits" with "about $X", the bracket chip and blurb, "Ready in A to B weeks after
  approval", "Sized for …" (names and platforms keep their capitals), the breakdown tile (ink, teal,
  marigold, ash, ruleStrong, moss), "Assumes", "What happens next" (iOS wording, step 4 mentions the
  handover guide and making it live), "Where to deliver", then the privacy promise (tealWash card, Privacy
  picture, bold "Your idea stays yours", "We use your brief only to build this project. We never sell it
  or use it to train AI, and we delete it from our servers when you accept the delivery."); under the
  button a lock and "Private. We delete your brief from our servers after delivery." (resubmit: "Your
  brief locks again until the team replies."). Resubmit: "You already paid N credits. This adds M credits." / "This returns M
  credits to your balance." / "No change."
- Delivery: "Your code is ready." / repository tile / "Handover guide" ("What we built and how to run
  it": `delivery.handoverUrl`, else `<repo>/blob/HEAD/HANDOVER.md`) / "Make it live" ("Steps to put it
  in front of customers") / Repository, Backend, From the team. Transfer and AWS lines are
  `GoLiveLogic.transferLine` / `awsLine`, worded as iOS.
- Refused project: "We can't take this project on", the server's reason, "Nothing has been charged.
  If you think this is a mistake, write to <supportEmail>." (the appeal is dropped when the server's
  reason already carries it). Policy refusals elsewhere show the server's message as is: the backend
  owns the "If you think this is a mistake…" sentence and the app never appends it.
- Offline: "Couldn't reach DownWork. Check your connection and try again."
- Timeline footer: "Projects are usually delivered well ahead of this date." (the quote screen
  shows `config.quote.timelineNote` from the backend instead).
